This repo contains all the ROS2 packages that interface different specialized sensors with robots and joysticks/controllers. They are all developed at the [AI4CE](https://ai4ce.github.io/) lab at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/).


They are tested on `Ubuntu 22.04` and `ROS2 Humble`. However, most of them do not rely on OS and ROS2 distro-specific features, so they should be easily portable.
